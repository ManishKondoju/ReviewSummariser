## Uses

### Direct Use

- Generate summaries for user reviews to improve content digestibility.
- Enhance e-commerce UX by auto-summarizing reviews.

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Manish014/review-summariser-gpt-config1")
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("Manish014/review-summariser-gpt-config1")

input_text = "summarize: The build quality is terrible and the support team was unhelpful."
inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True)
outputs = model.generate(inputs["input_ids"], max_length=60)
summary = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
